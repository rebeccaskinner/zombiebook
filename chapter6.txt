Chapter 6

Several hours had passed, Erik and Scott sat on upturned buckets in the middle
of the barricade not speaking, staring at the asphalt except when the movement
of one of the men caught their eye. After their inspection they'd gathered
their cloths and reported to Jason Verd, the man who they'd initially met, and
who seemed to be, if not a leader, at least a well respected member of the
militia. After a short briefing giving them effectively no information they
were given a little food- watered down vegetable beef soup, and told to stay
within the camp.
