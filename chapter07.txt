The men had sat in silence for some hours, watching dusk start to fall over the
camp.  They still hadn't seen Sam or Amanda, nor had any of their captors been
by to harass or question them.  The only sign of life, or unlife, outside of
their box had been the sound of a pair of vehicles driving past.

"Listen, Erik, I followed your lead back there..." Scott said as they sat on
the floor of the prison trailer.  "but I mean- don't you think we should have
tried to-" "Fight back? Escape?" Erik finshed.  He had taken a pair of the thin
blankets that had been stacked up in one corner and rolled them up loosely to
create a pair of cushions that the pair could sit on, letting their back rest
against the wall of the trailer.  "Yeah" Scott said-  "Or at least insisted
that we be allowed to see Sam and Amanda" he added.

"They wouldn't have allowed it.  I think that if we'd pushed the issue we would have just made them
more suspiscious of us, and I don't want that"  Erik said

"I don't know that it's possible for them to be meaningfully more suspscious of
us than they are already" Scott said, standing up and bending over to stretch
out his back.

"Maybe, but that doesn't mean we should provoke them.  For better or worse, I
think that guy we were talking to- Jason, I think he was being straight with
us.  Maybe he doesn't want to hurt us, I got the feeling he was being honest
when he said that, at any rate
I'm sure he WILL if he feels like we're going to be causing trouble" Erik added
while following Scotts lead by standing and streching.  "
